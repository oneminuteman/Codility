    Create a class Animal with a method speak that prints "Animal speaks!" to the console. Create a subclass Dog that inherits from Animal and overrides the 
    speak method to print "Dog barks!" instead.

      puts "Animal speaks!"

# Example usage
animal = Animal.new
animal.speak # Expected output: "Animal speaks!"
